# Output files

- The files in this folder are the output files generated by the jupyter notebooks stored in "./notebooks/..." and the display items in the study.
- The individual files are also displayed in the notebooks specified in notebook `04_gather_output.ipynb`.
- Note that not all figures may be produced, depending on the available data. For example, if the provided pre-fitted models from Zenodo are used, all produced results depend on the most common nine species and NOT on all species in the data.
